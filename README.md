# Ultrasound Image Segmentation and its Evaluation using Various Encoder Architectures 

### Brief description:

This code is used to perform segmentation in Ultrasound images. The methods used in this project are focused on [UNet architecture](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1505.04597) with different backbones used in the encoder. Initially aiming to compare the performance from [efficientnetB2](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1905.11946), [efficientnetB7](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1905.11946), and [PVT-v2-B5](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2106.13797) pretrained backbones.
